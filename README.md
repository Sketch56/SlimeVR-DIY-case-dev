# SlimeVR-DIY-case-dev
Development of alternative cases for DIY components.
This case development is specifically for a 804040 LiPo battery, SS22F32 DPDT slide switch, and JST ZH 5p connector

Current target components (and links personally sourced from):
 - Wemos D1 Mini

 - TP4056
   - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32649780468.html
 - MPU-6050

Note that components from different manufacturers may have slightly different dimensions and PCB thicknesses.
For alternative sizes, or to support different batteries and switches, one will need to edit the included F3D files.

Additional components
 - Schottky rectifier diodes (battery protection)

 - 180Kohm resistor (battery life sense)
   - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001436946770.html (mistaken purchase, you don't need 1W resistors)
 - 28GA wire (safe and thin enough)
   - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089CQ1C8L
 - JST ZH 5pin 1.5mm pitch (For aux IMU, can substitute with alternative connectors or directly soldered cables)

 - Filament
   At 0.2mm quality, 20% infill, tree supports from buildplate
   - Case: 16g, 2h41m
   - Lid: 6g, 49m
