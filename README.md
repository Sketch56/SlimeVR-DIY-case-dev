# SlimeVR-DIY-case-dev
Development of alternative cases for DIY components.
This case development is specifically for a 804040 LiPo battery, SS22F32 DPDT slide switch, and JST ZH 5p connector

Cases are numbered by [layout concept number].[major revision].[minor revision]

# Case model 5.3

Dims: 57.6\*56.6\*20.5mm  
A more traditional tray-based case similar to the Hyperion, though the switch is actually recessed into the lid rather than a side. This allows for a minimal tray size with an SS22F32 switch, and has convenient cutouts for cable management.

# Case model 8.0

Dims: 44.2\*57.2\*21.6mm

# Case model 9.0

Dims: 72.0\*44.2\*18.8mm

Other existing models will be added shortly
